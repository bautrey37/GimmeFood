## Idea for Restaurant Menu App

### Customer Use Case

Go in to a restaurant, sit down at a table, and scan the QR code on the table. The restaurantâ€™s menu pops up and lets you add dishes to your order and pay for them. The dish is brought to your table when ready.

### Restaurant Use Case

Lettings customers find their own seat and order their own food without anything delivered to them, reduces my staff costs. When a dish is no longer available, I can notify the backend and the customers will no longer be able to order that dish.

### UI Screens

- QR code scanner
- Display menu
- Add dishes to order
- (extra) Pay for meal

### Features

- Camera API to read QR code to know where to fetch menu data
- Persistent Storage using Firebase to store menu data of the dishes
- Web REST API to retrieve menu data from firebase to display in app
- (extra) Use Language Localization to retrieve menu in app settings language
- (extra) Use Stripe API / Google Pay to do test payments
